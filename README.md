## CRUD of tasks made in Node as a practise.

```
   This console application allows to make a CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) of tasks through an interactive menu with different options to keep an updated record of them and save it in a JSON file inside the same project (repository folder)
```

***Once the project is downloaded, it is necessary to execute the `npm install` command to download the required node modules.***
